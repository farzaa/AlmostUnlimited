# Almost Unlimited 

A Python based desktop application that uses a loophole in the Google terms of service to allow users of the app to upload an “Almost Unlimited” amounts of video, audio, and images. The app also allows users to download back whatever they uploaded by communicating with the backend, which is custom built using Google Spreadsheets because it’s free, and being clever is cool. 

Install our endless list of dependencies:

```
sudo pip install -r ./requirements.txt
brew install ffmpeg
```

Run the program:

```
python main.py
```

Generate your own API keys and replace them in the client_secret .json files, as well
as the Imgur_Uploader.py file

Enjoy
