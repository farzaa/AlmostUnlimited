# Almost Unlimited Storage

Video files are uploaded to YouTube through the YouTube API, and images through Imgur's API. YouTube offers
almost unlimited storage (625 videos per day). Imgur boasts a daily cap of 1,250 images.

Install our endless list of dependencies:

```
sudo pip install -r ./requirements.txt
brew install ffmpeg
```

Run the program:

```
python main.py
```

Generate your own API keys and replace them in the client_secret .json files, as well
as the Imgur_Uploader.py file

Enjoy
